	<h1>My Friend System<br>Assignment Home Page</h1>
	
	<h3>In this page I have answered a couple question listed in the assignment specifiacation. Those were:</h3><br>
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>What tasks you have not attempted or not completed?</li>				<!-- Question we had to answer -->
		<li>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</li>			
		<li>Which parts did you have trouble with?</li>
		<li>What would you like to do better next time?</li>
		<li>What additional features did you add to the assignment? (if any)</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<h3>The answers are right below in the following ordered list:</h3>
	<br>
	<ol>																	<!-- Answers -->
		<li>The tasks I haven't attempted are task 8 and 9, namely part 4 of the assignment.</li>				
		<li>I pretty much tried to follow the structure shown in the screenshots and then I added a CSS stylesheet that I thought would look best
		. Other than that, I didn't add or attemped any special features.</li>
		<li>Parts of the assignment I found quite challenging to accomplish were the creation the button in the add and friend list pages and the point were we 
		had to somehow think of a way to get access to all of the available friends the user can add in the add friend Page but I eventually figured out a way for both.</li>
		<li>Next time I would like to try and attemp the extra credit tasks because they seems to be within my capabilities.</li>
		<li>I didn't add any special features in the assignment.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<p>I did not participate in the discussion board conversation for Assingment 2 as I didnt fill the need to post anything there. I also did not answer
		anyones question as I did not wanna post anything that would be wrong and confuse other students.  <!-- Justification for not providing a screenshot -->
