# Friend-List

This is a Friend List web application I've created whist studying Web Application Develoment at Swinburne University.
The following code presents a web app that allows users to create an account that hold their friends as well as some 
basic information about them.

In more detail about the application:
* The user can sign up and login to their friend list
* There is a great level of input validation with a "Password" and "Confirm Password Feature".
* The details of all users are store in an SQL database using phpMyAdmin. The database contains 2 seperate tables, 1 for storing the login information
and 1 for containing their user they have in their friend list.
* As soon as the user logs in they are being redirected to their friend list. There, the user has the option of "Unfriending" users they no longer
want to be friends with.
* The user can also go to the **'Add Frined Page'** where they can add any user in the database as their friend.
* Initially this web app was hosted on Swinburne's Mercury Server but for the sake of testing Xampp was used.
